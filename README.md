## Team Krypton
- We are going to perform flood analysis.
Parts of Missouri experienced historic flooding in the month of May 2017. Some locations saw as much as 11 inches of rainfall.
- We will visualise the extent of damage at various prime locations. Compare it with visualisation from pre flooded area.
We'll try to classify floods by training the classifier and perform.
Next is impact assesment of local roads,secondary roads,primary roads,bridges,residential,commercials & railroad bridges.
Followed by visualisation of the impact.
We'll locate nearby firestations and their service area. Watch for flood barriers and plot the post-flood service area.
- When user runs the code they will get visual of the extent of damage at various prime locations, compared  with visualisation from pre flooded area, impact assesment of local roads,secondary roads,primary roads,bridges,residential,commercials,railroad,bridges. Followed by visualisation of the impact. 
The user will be able to locate nearby firestations and their service area.
- The dataset used is from ESRI(Environmental Systems Research Institute) Missouri floods.
- The code is in Python on a Jupyter Notebook.
